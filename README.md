# MCQ-and-T-F-question-generation
 Generating MCQ and True/False type questions using state of the art deep learning techniques
 If you require models that I trained please mail me at vaibhav.jain174@gmail.com.

This project targets edtech domain and was build to help school teachers in framing test questions. The idea is to build an end to end pipelines that takes any text as input and generate different types of question from it. Currently our pipeline can generate MCQ's, True/False and Fill in the blank type questions. We are working towards fine tuning our pipeline to be also able to generate general text to text questions.


 With the trained models in the correct folders run each notebook cell by cell to see the working of the whole idea. Details about each part of the pipeline is present in the notebook or at https://vaibhav174.github.io/question_gen.html
