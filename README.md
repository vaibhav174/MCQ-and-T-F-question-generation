# MCQ-and-T-F-question-generation
 Generating MCQ and True/False type questions using state of the art deep learning techniques
 If you require models that I trained please mail me at vaibhav.jain174@gmail.com.

This project targets edtech domain and was build to help school teachers in framing test questions. The idea is to build an end to end pipelines that takes any text as input and generate different types of question from it. Currently our pipeline can generate MCQ's, True/False and Fill in the blank type questions. We are working towards fine tuning our pipeline to be also able to generate general text to text questions.

The complete pipeline for MCQ type question generation is shown below

<ul>
	<li>The input text might be very big and not every sentence in the text might be important enough to build a question from. Therefore we first perform abstractive text summarization to not only reduce the text size but also to extract all the important information from the text.</li>
	<li>Most of the MCQ's are framed by asking the question around the keywords within the sentences. So we perform keyword extraction using spacy. This keyword will act as the correct option in the MCQ.</li>
	<li>Perform WSD using BERT-WSD to get the correct context of the keyword in the given sentence.</li>
	<li>Find the co-hypernyms of the keyword from WordNet using word sense generated by BERT-WSD. These words will act as wrong choices(Distractors) in the MCQ.</li>
	<li>Fine tune T5 transformer using SQuAD dataset to generate questions using keyword and text.</li>
	<li>Putting genetated question along with correct choice and distractors to create a complete MCQ.</li>
</ul>


 With the trained models in the correct folders run each notebook cell by cell to see the working of the whole idea. Details about each part of the pipeline is present in the notebook or at https://vaibhav174.github.io/question_gen.html
